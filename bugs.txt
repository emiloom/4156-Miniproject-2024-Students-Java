IndividualProjectApplication.java
1: Was getting index out of bounds in IndividualProjectApplication.java getCourseMap method 
due to typo in hardcoded lists.

Department.java
1. return actual string value rather than "...toString()"
2. Need to use Map interface instead of just hashmap to then use mock and anyMap() in test

RouteController.java
1. Missing javadocs
2. formatting + findCourseTime => fixed to have accurate return for course timeslot
(these took me way too long)
3. OK and NOT_FOUND was opposite for retrieveDepartment
4. FORBIDDEN should be NOT_FOUND in getMajorCtFromDept
5.  FORBIDDEN should be OK in retrieveCourse

Course.java
1. Need Override on toString
2. isCourseFull typo with comparison
