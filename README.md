Here is what I did for this part of the project:

I did not use a bug finder, I only used mvn checkstyle:check (although I used a few things such as ctrl + shift + p > format document, and ctrl+shift+L, I could not get rid of the white space errors).

Added a pmd pluggin in the pom.xml file at some point but wasn't sure how to work with it so I didn't end up using it.
